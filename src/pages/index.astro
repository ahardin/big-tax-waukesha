				<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">MAJOR UPDATE 10/22/2024</h3>
				<p>
					Less than an hour before the board meeting, County Executive
					Paul Farrow withdrew the sales tax ordinance from the
					meeting's agenda. It will certainly be back, but this is a
					small win.
				</p>

				<p>
					Expect an intense marketing campaign from the county trying
					to convince you that raising taxes is the only way to solve
					the budget shortfall. But remember, the county also said
					that it was cruical for this ordinance to be passed <em
						>right now</em
					>, yet all it took was a few people speaking up to make them
					delay the vote.
				</p>

				<p>
					Local politicians often go along to get along, but they
					aren't all sellouts. You have a lot more power with
					county/municipal/school board members than you do with your
					US or even State Senator. Continue to pay attention to this
					and keep pressure on your supervisor.
				</p>

				<p>You can make a difference.</p>

				<p>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p>
